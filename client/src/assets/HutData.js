        details:
            'This hut, constructed in September of 1997,replaced a small 30 year old structure that had seen its better days and was too small to meet the demands of an ever-growing interest of hikers and skiers to see the beautiful vistas of Jumbo Pass.  The new 8 person cabin was a joint project involving the Columbia Valley Hut Society and a Forest Renewal B.C. grant.  It sits on the ridge along the Purcell divide, about .5 km north of Jumbo Pass.  There is quality hiking, scrambling and ski touring available in this small alpine location. Views are superb and include Karnak and Jumbo Mountains to the north-east and Cauldron/Horseshoe glaciers to the south-west.  A nearby tarn, just to the east of the cabin, is the summer season drinking water source. Please use firewood sparingly,  during winter only. It is very expensive to fly in! Bonfires are prohibited. The sensitive subalpine ecosystem of the Jumbo Pass area craze nnot sustain any firewood cutting, please refrain from this damaging practice.',
        access: 'Trailhead parking (roadside) will vary from one year to the next as it is dependant upon current government funding for back-country road maintenance and the existence of active logging in the area.  Drive the Toby Creek road for 18 kms past Panorama Mountain Resort, then turn right onto the Jumbo Creek road.  For winter access, this junction generally marks the end of the plowed portion of the road.  For summer travelers, the traditional parking area is located at the 15.4 km mark on the Jumbo Creek Road.  The trail begins by following a skid road that heads off to the left from the road.  Jumbo Pass is also accessible from the West Kootenays on the Glacier Creek Forest Service Road.  The trailhead and normal parking area is at km 27.  A washed out culvert will stop low clearance vehicles near the 24 km.  It is advisable to use a 4-wheel drive vehicle on any non-maintained backcountry road. The summer route up is usually fairly easy to follow from either side of the Pass as this is one of the more popular summer hikes in the Purcells. However, it is always advisable to bring a topographical map with you and know how to use it! Hiking time is usually 2.5 to 3 hours in the summer and up to 6.5 hours ski touring in the winter depending on conditions.',
